# A predictive equation for wave setup using genetic programming [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/612002327.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/612002327)
Use of the [GpLearn Model](https://github.com/trevorstephens/gplearn) to identify a mathematical expression that best describes wave setup. The dataset is available in [Stockdon & Holman (2011)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/602/) and also can be downloaded from [Coastal and Ocean Collective](https://coastalhub.science/data)/Wave Runup Field Data.

The GpLearn model parameters can be changed according to its [documentation](https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
